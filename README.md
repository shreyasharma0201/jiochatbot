#### RAG Chatbot for Jio Pay

The goal of this project was to develop a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance response accuracy and contextual understanding. Unlike traditional chatbots, RAG integrates retrieval-based and generative methods to fetch relevant information before generating responses, making it useful for customer support, knowledge management, and learning.

The chatbot was built through data collection, model training using dense retrievers and generative transformers, fine-tuning, and deployment via API for web and messaging platforms.

Key features include real-time information retrieval, scalability across industries.
